MSP430 and TM4C123G microcontroller based programs

• Lab 1:-\
Aim: Program the following requirements on TI's MSP430 Launchpad with the help of its on-board peripherals.\
Objectives:-
1. LED2 Blinks at a frequency of 0.5 Hz, 50% duty cycle
2. The LED only blinks when button S2 is not held down
3. When button S2 is held down for at least 2 seconds, when S2 is finally released LED2 stops blinking and LED1 begins blinking.
4. The configuration is reversed when S2 is again pressed for at least 2 seconds again.

• Lab 2:-\
Aim: Understand how to utilize the analog to digital converter (ADC) peripheral on TI's MSP430 Launchpad. In this lab, a potentiometer is connected to an ADC input pin, the analog value is read, and that voltage is expressed on an LED array bar.\
Objectives:-
1. ADC Voltages are properly read from the potentionmeter.
2. The LED Bar lights up and can be controlled properly
3. The ADC Value is scaled properly and displayed on the LED Bar (with no oscillations)
